Pot Limit Omaha (PLO) games at the Hard Rock Tampa casino run somewhat infrequently so I've created this script to help keep me up to date on when PLO games are running at the Casino so I don't have to check the Hard Rock website everytime I want to play poker.

# Instructions
1. You will have to create a Brave Live Poker account see what games are running so create an account by clicking the red 'Signup' button on the top right of the screen [here](https://www.bravopokerlive.com/login/?ReturnUrl=%2fvenues%2fseminole-hard-rock-tampa%2f).
2. Then you will have to replace the first two lines of code in the 'notifier.py' file with your Bravo Poker account credentials.
3. Next replace sender email and email password with your own email address and password.
4. Finally replace receiver email with the email that you want to send the notifications to.

I used this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2Cr_YRQk7o) to have the script run every hour to keep me up to date on when games are running.
